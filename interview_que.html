    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <ol>
    <li>1. In components based architecture what is spec file?</li>
    <p>A spec file contains test cases written to ensure that a specific component, function, or module behaves as expected.
        The term "spec" is short for specification, as it defines what the code under test should do.</p>
    <li>2. what is the name of the tree in DOM?</li>
    <P>N-Array tree</P>
    <li>3. First step to make a repository in git?</li>
    <p>git init</p>
    <li>4. Git is centralized or distributed?</li>
    <p>Distributed</p>
    <li>5. Why git is fast in executing the commands type?</li>
    <p>git is developed in C language</p>
    <li>6. How staging area is called before push?</li>
    <p>Caching area</p>
    <li>7. Root folder is called as repository then the sub folder in repository is called as?</li>
    <p>Not(folder,repository,sub folder)</p>
    <li>8. If h1.../h1 is given in the html file without the basic structure of html,what is the output?</li>
    <p>The content inside the h1 tag(As it is the html file, it takes the basic structure automatically)</p>
    <li>9. If title.../title is given in the html file without the baic structure of html,what is the output?</li>
    <p>The content inside the title tag will be the title of the tab(As it is the html file, it takes the basic structure automatically)</p>
    <li>10. If h1.../h1 title..../title is given in the html file without the basic Structure, What is the output and Why does title tag comes in body?</li>
    <p>The title tag appears in the body when inspecting because the browser encounters visible content like h1 first, causing it to start rendering the body implicitly before processing the title.</p>
    <li>11. In for in loop while traversing through an object why the output is undefined when accessing using dot operator ?</li>
    <p>The output is undefined because obj.key is looking for a property literally named "key" in the object, instead of dynamically accessing the property using the value of the key variable.</p>
    <li>12. Why Components should start with Capital letter?</li>
    <p>Components should start with a capital letter because React uses capitalized names to differentiate components from standard HTML tags.</p>
    <li>13.  While exporting a component why default keyword is mandatory? </li>
    <p>The default keyword is not mandatory; it specifies a default export, allowing the component to be imported without curly braces, unlike named exports which require them.</p>
    <li>14.  What is use of StrictMode in main.jsx? </li>
    <p>React's StrictMode is used to highlight potential problems in an application by enabling additional checks and warnings for its child components during development.
    It helps developers write better, more resilient code by detecting unsafe lifecycle methods, legacy API usage, and unexpected side effects.</p>
    <li>15.  What is the revenue of WhatsApp? </li>
    <p>Though WhatsApp's financial statements aren't public (Meta doesn't break down its revenue by company), estimates put annual revenues at about $1.3 billion as of late 2024. That's less than 1% of Meta's yearly revenues. In the past decade, WhatsApp has barely made much in the way of gains to offset its 2014 purchase price.</p>
    <li>16.  What is Linting error? </li>
    <p>A linting error is a code issue identified by a linter tool that flags deviations from coding standards, style guidelines, or best practices. It helps improve code quality, readability, and prevents potential bugs.</p>
