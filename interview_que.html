    <li>10. If h1.../h1 title..../title is given in the html file without the basic Structure, What is the output and Why does title tag comes in body?</li>
    <p>The title tag appears in the body when inspecting because the browser encounters visible content like h1 first, causing it to start rendering the body implicitly before processing the title.</p>
    <li>7. In for in loop while traversing through an object why the output is undefined when accessing using dot operator ?</li>
    <p>The output is undefined because obj.key is looking for a property literally named "key" in the object, instead of dynamically accessing the property using the value of the key variable.</p>
    <li>8. Why Components should start with Capital letter?</li>
    <p>Components should start with a capital letter because React uses capitalized names to differentiate components from standard HTML tags.</p>
    <li>9.  While exporting a component why default keyword is mandatory? </li>
    <p>The default keyword is not mandatory; it specifies a default export, allowing the component to be imported without curly braces, unlike named exports which require them.</p>
